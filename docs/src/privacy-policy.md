Obsidian Reminder Plugin is a plugin for Obsidian that allows you to list reminders in markdown, notify them, and synchronize them with external systems (Google Calendar, Google Tasks).  
It uses Google API for synchronization of reminders to external systems.

To ensure seamless Google authentication from Obsidian, we only use an intermediary server for authentication (henceforth "intermediary server").

All personal information, such as calendars and tasks, is communicated directly from Obsidian, so no intermediary server is involved.
The intermediary server only temporarily receives an authentication code at the time of authentication, but does not use or store that code.
